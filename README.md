# pipfy

a floating webcam image on your desktop: picture-in-picture for your webcam in a browser window. hence the name.

## usage

best for desktop use. click on start video, then allow your browser to access your webcam of choice. click on hover (or right click -> pip) to trigger the floating picture-in-picture window. you can flip the image if you prefer to watch yourself in mirrored view.

known issue: the canvas element that allows us to manipulate the video image does not yet resize high resolution cameras to fit the canvas. we'll add cropping options later.

## license
